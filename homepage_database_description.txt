<h2> GLdb: HNRCA Genomics Lab Database </h2>

<h3> About <h/3>

<p>
The GLdb is a database of food-based compounds and human proteins known to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
The food compounds in the database have been predicted to regulate the expression of human genes by a machine
learning software called <a href = "https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-020-03582-7" target="_blank">PhyteByte</a>
By potentially regulating these human genes, human proteins involved in the induction of the SARS-CoV-2 virus
are appropriately upregulated or downregulated, to reduce the chance of viral infection in a human host.
</p>

<p>
The severity of COVID-19 is highly age-associated. A <a href = "https://europepmc.org/article/pmc/pmc7681045" target="_blank">LonGenity cohort study</a> identified a list of human genes whose expression is significantly associated with changes in chronological age. The GLdb includes
the Longenity age-associated protein data, to identify SARS-CoV-2 related human proteins and their viral human
protein interaction clusters (VHI) which may play a role in COVID-19 age-associated severity.
</p>

<p>
Listed in the database are food compounds (1,122), food compound source-foods (763), human proteins
(236 [catalogued as gene names]), age-associated proteins (4,122), and compound-protein interaction
data output from PhyteByte (2,223).

<h3> Functions <h/3>

<p>
The database can query:
All compounds that target a specific VHI protein
Individual compound-protein interactions
Potentially high impact foods for COVID-19 protection (counts of protein targeting compounds grouped by food name)
SARS-CoV-2 VHI age-associated proteins and protective food compounds
Search and display graphical networks of SARS-CoV-2 VHI protein-protein interactions
Search with a user-defined query
